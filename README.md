# Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN)

This repository demonstrates the implementation of a **Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN)** using PyTorch. The model generates images conditioned on specific labels.

---

## 🌟 Key Features

- Conditional image generation based on class labels.
- Custom dataset integration for training and evaluation.
- Visualization of generator outputs during training.
- Uses **Binary Cross-Entropy Loss** optimized with the **Adam Optimizer**.

🚀 Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.8+
PyTorch 1.12+
Libraries:
torch
torchvision
matplotlib
Install dependencies using:

bash
Copy code
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib
Training the CGAN
Prepare Dataset
Replace the dataset path in the data_loader section of train.py with the path to your custom dataset.

Run Training
Run the training script to train the CGAN:

bash
Copy code
python train.py
Training outputs, including generated images and model checkpoints, will be saved in the outputs/ directory.

Evaluate the Model
Use the trained model to generate conditional samples:

bash
Copy code
python generate.py
🏗️ Model Architecture
Generator
Takes:
A random noise vector (z) as input.
A one-hot encoded label (c) for conditional input.
Outputs:
An image G(z, c).
Discriminator
Takes:
A real or fake image as input.
A corresponding label (c) for conditional verification.
Outputs:
A single value indicating whether the input is real or fake.
📊 Loss Functions
Binary Cross-Entropy Loss (BCE):

Used for both generator and discriminator.
Defined as:
python
Copy code
adversarial_loss = torch.nn.BCELoss()
Optimization:

Optimized using the Adam Optimizer:
python
Copy code
optimizer_G = torch.optim.Adam(generator.parameters(), lr=0.0002, betas=(0.5, 0.999))
optimizer_D = torch.optim.Adam(discriminator.parameters(), lr=0.0002, betas=(0.5, 0.999))
🖼️ Example Outputs
Sample images generated by the CGAN conditioned on class labels:
