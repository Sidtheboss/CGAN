# Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN)

This repository implements a **Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN)** to generate images conditioned on specific labels. The project is built using **PyTorch** and is designed to demonstrate the core concepts of GANs with conditional input.

---

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features

- **Conditional GAN Architecture**:
  - Combines a generator and a discriminator.
  - Conditions both generator and discriminator on class labels.

- **Custom Dataset Integration**:
  - Easily integrate your dataset by modifying the data loading pipeline.
  - Conditional labels are passed during training.

- **Evaluation and Visualization**:
  - Generate and save images conditioned on specific labels.
  - Loss metrics for generator and discriminator are tracked during training.
